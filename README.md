# Day2-with-java

Here is my Day 2 of my 30 days coding challenge. To day i learned how some basic and necessary concepts hat are most important for every java developer. 

Here we go......

Java won't follow ASCII, it follows Unicode i.e Universal code simply we call it as UTF-16.

In java there are mainly two types of data types. They are primitive and non-primitive datatypes.

Primitive data types are Byte, Short, Int, Long, Float, Double, Boolean, Char.

Non-primitive data types are String, Array, Class.

In java datatypes such as Byte, short, int, long and char follws Base2 format. And Float, Double follows IEEE format. 

We have two types of type casting in java, they are

Implicit Typecasting and Explicit Typecasting.

Implicit Type castening means converting smaller datatype to larger datatype. Example for implicit typecasting is convertion from Byte to short. Here no data loss will happens.

Explicit type casting means converting larger dataype to smaller datatype. Example for explicit typecasting is  conversion from long to int.  Here while converting, there is possibility for loosing the data.
